# 4champ Development Journal

### 3 April 2018

These pages are created to document my development efforts and related endeavours around 4champ mod player app.
I hope publishing my progress here will inspire me to give the project a nudge more often than during past months.

As a first entry to this dev journal I guess it would make sense to introduce the project and the goals, 
as I have not pushed any code yet. Basically, I have two main goals for 4champ in 2018:

1. Rewrite the app in Swift. I'll write down the [history of 4champ](app_history.md) on a separate page where I'll
elaborate why I want to do the rewrite.
2. Find a way to get listed on AppStore again. The story about [why I had to remove 4champ from AppStore](appstore_removal.md) 
will also be posted on a separate page
