4champ is an app that provides a mobile interface to [Amiga Music Preservation](http://amp.dascene.net) database on iOS devices.

Many of us who grew up with computers in the 80's and early 90's remember Amiga and particularly its 
mind-blowing audio capabilities which were unrivaled at the era. Amiga inspired a lot of musicians to 
produce vast amount of compositions, or modules as they were called. [Amiga Music Preservation](http://amp.dascene.net) is a non-profit 
project run by demosceners that collects anything related to Amiga music production. Their database boasts over 
140 thousand modules, and now you can access them easily from your iOS device using 4champ app.
