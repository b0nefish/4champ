# 4champ
4champ is an app that provides a mobile interface to [Amiga Music Preservation](http://amp.dascene.net) database on iOS devices.

Many of us who grew up with computers in the 80's and early 90's remember Amiga and particularly its 
mind-blowing audio capabilities which were unrivaled at the era. Amiga inspired a lot of musicians to 
produce vast amount of compositions, or modules as they were called. [Amiga Music Preservation](http://amp.dascene.net) is a non-profit 
project that collects anything related to Amiga music production. Their database boasts over 
140 thousand modules, 4champ app is your direct access to it.
